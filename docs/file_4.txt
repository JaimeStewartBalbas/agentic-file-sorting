Quantum computing represents a major shift in how we process information by utilizing the principles of superposition and entanglement.
Unlike classical computers that use bits as either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for exponentially faster calculations in specific fields.
Scientists are working to overcome the challenges of decoherence and error correction to build stable, large-scale quantum systems.
This technology has the potential to revolutionize cryptography, materials science, and drug discovery.
