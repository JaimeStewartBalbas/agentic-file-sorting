The exploration of Mars has accelerated in recent years, with several rovers investigating its surface for signs of ancient life.
Researchers are particularly interested in the Jezero Crater, where evidence suggests a river delta once existed billions of years ago.
These missions rely on advanced spectrometers and high-resolution cameras to analyze rock samples and soil composition.
Understanding the geological history of Mars provides critical insights into the evolution of our own solar system.
