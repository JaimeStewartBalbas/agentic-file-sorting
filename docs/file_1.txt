Financial markets are heavily influenced by decisions made by central banks.
When interest rates are increased, borrowing becomes more expensive for companies and individuals, which can slow down economic growth.
On the other hand, lower interest rates tend to encourage investment, spending, and risk-taking in the stock market.
Investors closely monitor inflation data, employment reports, and monetary policy announcements to adjust their strategies.
